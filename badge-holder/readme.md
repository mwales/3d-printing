# Badge Holder

This is going to be the first print I attempt on my new 3d printer.  It's a parametric model of
a badge holder.  I constantly break my badge where it has a hole punched in it to attach to a
lanyard.

I'm hoping that I can just incase the badge in this hindged holder, and lock it in place, and give
it some protection from physical abuse and damage.
