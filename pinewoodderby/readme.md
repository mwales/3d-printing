My twin boys are about to graduate from cubscouts to boyscouts, so I don't think
they will be participating in the pinewood derby anymore.  Since it was my last
car, I decided to throw out the rulebook and build something fun.

Goals:
* Jet fan propulsion
* Lights inside the jet engine to show rotation and afterburner effects
* KITT scanner light in the front
* Bluetooth remote control
* Sound
 * Play jet sound (if fan doesn't sound like one)
 * Play jet pop
 * Play KITT scanner sound
 * Play General Lee Old Dixie Horn
 * Play Back to the Future "When this baby hits 88mph..."
 * Play car songs
* Light show effects / Cop Songs
 * Sound of da Police
 * Bad Boys
* Waynes World / Bohemian Rhapsody

STL Files Included

* KITT.stl = Main floor and sides of the cockpit. Speaker mount included
* roof.stl = Whole roof as one piece (hard to print this way)
* roof1.stl = Front part of roof, easy to print
* roof2.stl = Top part of roof, easy to print
* roof3.stl = Shorter roof to use with the roof extender
* roof_extender.stl = Raises the roof a few millimeters incase more room needed in cockpit for computer and stuff
