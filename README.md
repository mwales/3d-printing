# 3d-printing
Models and any scripts I create to help with 3D printing needs

## [Badge Holder](badge-holder)

This doesn't actually print, I need to work on it later.

## [3-D Printer Enclosure](printer_enclosure)

An enclosure I created from some 3d printed parts, and some large pieces of
Lexan / Polycarbonate sheets.

## [Logo and Challenge Coin Holder](3dlogo)

This was a semi-successful print.  The logo part came out good, but the coin
holder part only partially printed successfully.  Going to work on some
improvements for it.
